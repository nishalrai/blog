						<span style="margin-left: 50px;">It’s a very interesting fact and surprise to know the impact of internet in these days. Our daily life is depending on desires and goals due to the extensive use of internet. It’s been a universal fact about the both positive and negative impact of every aspects. However, the positive impact has boomed the humanity development in a great extent. While there are various uses of the Internet but you can use the internet for getting an online education. We can use the Internet to promote your business online. We can do online courses and improve your writing, communication, business and online marketing skills. Online shopping, social media, emails, chatting are common things that we do daily. The global network of computers has changed our lives tremendously. We are hungry to use the Internet. That’s why more than 40% of the world’s  population is connected to the Internet according to <strong>internetlivestatus.com. </strong><br>
	    				We, usually start our day after notifications and emails. This means that as soon as we wake up we are flooded with information from different sources.  Sometimes, it is struggling to prioritize and decide which information is useful and which is not.  Using the Internet positively means we can decide what is important for the day. The Internet has made life a lot easier by making information more accessible to all and creating connections with different people around the world. However, it has also led a lot of people to spend too much time in front of the computer, so much so that it becomes the center of their lives. This can lead to an Internet or computer addiction. Howevr, in case of it's advantages cannot be missed.<br>
	    				One of the positives that technology provides is often found in the classroom to assist learning. Traditional classrooms have a chalkboard where a teacher delivers lessons and instructions to students. Technology in the classroom has manifested itself so that teachers can use a whiteboard to teach students. These whiteboards allow teachers to call up presentations for their class. Instead of using chalk as one would do on a chalkboard, a teacher simply needs to wipe away whatever is written with a standard eraser or a damp cloth and then start teaching another subject. Other common examples of technology in the classroom come from the computers the students use to do class work and homework. They can communicate with their teachers away from school by using email, text messaging and video calling.<br>

						Mobile phones have become a staple of our society, with everyone from elementary school kids to senior citizens owning at least one. Although mobile apps and texting have made our lives easier, some question the impact they’ve had on the relationships we have with one another. <br>
	                    “I have a mobile phone that is a basic flip phone where it talks aloud to tell me who is calling and reads all the screens and text aloud,” she says. “I really love the fact I am not always looking at a phone. I can interact and socialize and truly have to be in each moment because I cannot distract or amuse myself with my phone.<br>
	                    A lot of changes have occurred in our lives due to the use of cellphones. Most of the changes, has produced many beneficial effects in people’s life. Accelerating the development and easy to perform various jobs without much difficulty. In many ways, it brought many effects which can save us from undergoing the long and hectic procedures. There are many examples around us which can make us understand that how technology has changed our lives. Another way of realizing is by taking an example of good communication services which we have got in few years due to excellent development of network and wireless communication. Now, we can remain in contact with anyone anywhere in the world by using the benefits of cellphones. Along with the positive impacts, there are negative effects of technology too. It has given us the chance to make changes in our lives in either way.

						<span style="margin-left: 50px;">Technology is a body of knowledge devoted to creating tools, processing actions and the extracting of materials. The term ‘Technology” is wide, and everyone has their way of understanding its meaning. We use technology to accomplish various tasks in our daily lives, in brief; we can describe technology as products and processes used to simplify our daily lives. We use technology to extend our abilities, making people the most crucial part of any technological system. Technology, is also an application of science used to solve problems. But it is vital to know that technology and science are different subjects which work hand-in-hand to accomplish specific tasks or solve problems.<br>
	    				We apply technology in almost everything we do in our daily lives; we use technology at work, we use technology for communication, transportation, learning, manufacturing, securing data, scaling businesses and so much more. Technology is human knowledge which involves tools, materials, and systems. The application of technology typically results in products. If technology is well applied, it benefits humans, but the opposite is true, if used for malicious reasons.<br>
	    				Many businesses are using technology to stay competitive, they create new products and services using technology, and they also use technology to deliver those products and services to their customers on time and within budget. A good example is mobile phones companies like Apple & Samsung, these mobile empires, use high-end technology to create new smartphones and other electronic devices to stay competitive. This competitive edge is gained through employing advanced technology. But, it has also seriously threathen the privacy and freedom in the current days. It's very hard to maintain a privacy and keep the information safe from the unknown people due to the available of mass technology over the world. The high rate of data development and lack of precautions about the threats and danger from the hacking has been an alaraming threat to the Information technology industry.
